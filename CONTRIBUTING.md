## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Windows 10/11 development environment
- Visual Studio 2022 or VS Code with C# extension
- .NET 6.0 SDK or later
- Git for version control

### Development Setup
1. **Fork and Clone**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/namba-dhn.git
   cd namba-dhn
   ```

2. **Open in IDE**
   - Open `StealthAssistant.sln` in Visual Studio 2022
   - Or open the folder in VS Code

3. **Configure Environment**
   - Create a `.env` file in the `dist` folder
   - Add your Gemini API key for testing

4. **Build and Test**
   ```powershell
   .\build.ps1
   ```

## üìù Code Guidelines

### C# Coding Standards
- Follow Microsoft C# naming conventions
- Use meaningful variable and method names
- Add XML documentation for public APIs
- Keep methods focused and under 50 lines when possible
- Use async/await for I/O operations

### Project Structure
- **Program.cs**: Application entry point
- **StealthAssistantCore.cs**: Main application logic
- **ZKeySequenceWindow.cs**: Global hotkey handling
- **ResponsePopup.cs**: UI notifications
- Keep related functionality together

### Stealth Requirements
- Maintain process obfuscation techniques
- Preserve memory optimization features
- Ensure anti-detection capabilities remain intact
- Test with various monitoring software

### API Integration
- Handle all API errors gracefully
- Implement proper timeout mechanisms
- Respect rate limiting
- Maintain conversation context

## üß™ Testing

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] All hotkeys work correctly (Z+M, Z+S, Z+Q, Z+J, Z+A)
- [ ] Application runs without visible windows
- [ ] API responses are properly formatted
- [ ] Clipboard operations work as expected
- [ ] Mouse notifications function correctly
- [ ] MCQ cursor movement works for all options
- [ ] Memory usage remains stable over time

### Stealth Testing
- [ ] Process appears as "Windows Service Host"
- [ ] No taskbar presence
- [ ] Minimal resource footprint
- [ ] Hidden from Alt+Tab
- [ ] Undetectable by common monitoring tools

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Invalid API keys
- [ ] Network connectivity issues
- [ ] Large response handling
- [ ] Rapid hotkey sequences
- [ ] Empty clipboard scenarios

## üêõ Bug Reports

When reporting bugs, please include:

```

## ‚ú® Feature Requests

### Proposal Format
When suggesting new features:

1. **Use Case**: Describe the problem this solves
2. **Proposed Solution**: Detailed implementation approach
3. **Alternatives**: Other solutions considered
4. **Compatibility**: Impact on existing functionality
5. **Priority**: Low/Medium/High with justification

### Example Feature Request
```markdown
**Feature**: Custom hotkey configuration

**Use Case**: Users want to customize Z+key combinations to their preference

**Proposed Solution**: 
- Add configuration file for hotkey mapping
- UI for hotkey selection
- Conflict detection system

**Alternatives**: 
- Command-line configuration
- Registry-based settings

**Compatibility**: Backward compatible with defaults
**Priority**: Medium - Quality of life improvement
```

## üîß Development Workflow

### Branch Naming
- `feature/short-description` for new features
- `bugfix/issue-description` for bug fixes
- `docs/update-description` for documentation
- `refactor/component-name` for code refactoring
